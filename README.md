## Module 12 Challenge: Belly Button Graphs

### Purpose of the analysis
The setting for this assignment involved a company seeking new ways to produce synthetic meat products. As a possible source of organic material, they collected bacterial samples from the navels of volunteers in the hopes of identifying beneficial strains that could serve as the basis for a new production process.


### Features of the page
The analysis on this page is designed to allow volunteers to see the results of the lab work on their own samples. Volunteers would use the drop menu to select their ID number, and the page will update to show:

- A bar chart of the ten highest populations in their sample. This includes the ability to mouse over a bar and see a text entry that explains what strains were identified.

- A gauge relating the volunteer's reported frequency of cleaning their navel compared to the highest and lowest reported numbers in the study

- A bubble plot showing the count values for the different bacterial strains in the sample. Again, hover text was added to explain the contents identified by each OTU number.


### Modifications to page style
The starter HTML file was modified in the following ways:

- The background image of the jumbotron division was added to reflect the content of the page

- The body font color was updated to contrast with the image

- The background of the non-chart areas of the page was changed in color to match the jumbotron image

- An explanatory paragraph was added
